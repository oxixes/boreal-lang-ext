# Boreal Language Extension for Visual Studio Code

This extension provides syntax highlighting support for the Boreal programming language in Visual Studio Code.

Boreal is a language used in the subject 'Traductores de Lenguajes' at the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, designed to help students learn about language translation and compiler construction.

The extension currently only supports syntax highlighting, but future updates may include additional features such as error checking and code completion.

## Features

- Syntax highlighting for Boreal language constructs.

## Known Issues

- Functions may be colored as variables if parentheses are not used or appear in the next line after the function name. This will be addressed in future updates when a language server is implemented.
